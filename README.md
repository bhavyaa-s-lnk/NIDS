# 🛡️ Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

A Python-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) designed to monitor live network traffic, detect suspicious activities using rule-based logic and anomaly scoring, and present insights via a real-time Flask web dashboard.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project captures and analyzes network packets in real time to identify potential intrusions such as suspicious IP behavior, abnormal traffic patterns, and rule violations. It is built using Python, Scapy, Flask, and modular OOP design for scalability and clarity.

### Suitable for:
- Academic projects
- Cybersecurity learning
- IDS/NIDS fundamentals
- Research & experimentation

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Live packet sniffing using Scapy
- Rule-based intrusion detection
- Anomaly / ML-style scoring system
- Real-time Flask dashboard
- JSON-based alert logging
- Multithreaded architecture
- Object-oriented code structure

---

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Scapy
- Flask
- Threading
- JSON
- OOP principles

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Packet Capture** – Live packets captured using Scapy  
2. **Detection** – Rules & anomaly scores applied  
3. **Alerting** – Suspicious activity logged  
4. **Visualization** – Real-time dashboard display
